# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
## Background Context

## Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
Starting from today:  
- Based on the requirements of each task, **you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first**, before you actually code anything
- The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. **But not in the implementation of them!**
- **Don’t trust the user**, always think about all possible edge cases

## Resources
**Read or watch:**

- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings”included)](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/doctest.html)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://pymotw.com/3/doctest/)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lfv5tUGsn8)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google:**

## General
- Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

## Requirements
## Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc


## Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
